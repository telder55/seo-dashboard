## Description

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a large part of many businesses digital marketing efforts. The main idea behind SEO Dashboard was to create an easy way to view data on how well your business is ranking and getting found on Google and other search platforms. Often, you need to log in into multiple accounts to see analytics data for your business. SEO Dashboard would put search analytics from Google Search, Google My Business, Bing, Facebook and more in order to easily see how your business is performing organically on the web.
